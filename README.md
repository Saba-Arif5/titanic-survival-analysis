# Titanic Survival Analysis

## Project Overview
This project explores the Titanic dataset to understand the factors that influenced passenger survival.  
The analysis follows a structured data analysis workflow, starting from data wrangling and progressing through exploratory data analysis and visualization.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate practical data analysis skills using Python and common data science libraries.

## Analysis Steps

### 1. Data Wrangling
- Loaded and inspected the dataset
- Handled missing values
- Cleaned and formatted relevant features
- Prepared the dataset for analysis

### 2. Initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Examined survival rates across key variables
- Analyzed distributions of age, class, and gender
- Identified early patterns and potential predictors

### 3. Data Visualization
- Visualized survival trends using plots
- Compared survival across passenger classes and genders
- Used charts to support analytical observations
